## Code Challenge 06 - When does PyPI reach 100K packages?

> This week, each one of you has a homework assignment ... - Tyler Durden (Fight club)

### A milestone right around the corner

A new week, more coding! 

We are grabbing this challenge from [Raymond Hettinger's tweet](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/829474817082433536) (EAFP):

> python data extrapolation contest: Tweet your prediction of the exact date and time(UTC) that http://pypi.python.org  hits 100,000 packages

The submitted answers (tweet replies) were very different which made us curious. As it's a prediction there won't be one right answer of course. We challenge you to find a data set to make your prediction. We are curious what you will come up with ...

### To follow along with our challenges

Start coding by [forking our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges):

    $ git clone https://github.com/pybites/challenges

If you already forked it [sync it](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/):

    #Â assuming using ssh key
    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:pybites/challenges.git 
    $ git fetch upstream
    # if not on master: 
    $ git checkout master 
    $ git merge upstream/master
    # cp pypi100k-template.py pypi100k.py
    # code

Remember: there is no best solution, only learning more/ better Python. We're looking forward reviewing our and your solutions end of this week. Good luck and have fun!
